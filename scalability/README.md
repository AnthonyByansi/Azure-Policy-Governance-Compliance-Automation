## Introduction

Scalability is a critical aspect of cloud computing. Azure provides a suite of tools and services to help you scale your applications and infrastructure efficiently. This directory offers resources and guidance to ensure your solutions can adapt and grow as needed.

## Scalability Fundamentals

Explore fundamental concepts of scalability:

- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**: Understand the differences between scaling out and up.
- **Stateless vs. Stateful Architectures**: Learn how to design applications for scalability.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Implement microservices to enhance scalability and flexibility.

## Azure Auto Scaling

### [auto-scaling-configurations.json](./auto-scaling-configurations.json)

This JSON file defines auto-scaling configurations, allowing your Azure resources to automatically adjust based on demand. It helps you optimize resource usage and improve application performance.

## Load Balancing

Discover load balancing strategies and resources:

- **Azure Load Balancer**: Implement load balancing for high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Application Gateway**: Use Azure Application Gateway for advanced traffic management.
- **Traffic Manager**: Distribute user traffic to global data centers for scalability.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Explore resources related to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

- **Container Orchestration**: Learn how AKS simplifies container management and scaling.
- **Scaling Kubernetes Pods**: Configure AKS to automatically scale pods based on CPU and memory usage.
