## Introduction

This directory is dedicated to managing Azure Management Groups using Terraform. Azure Management Groups allow you to efficiently organize your Azure resources, apply policies, and maintain governance across your Azure subscriptions.

## Management Groups Overview

- **What are Management Groups?**: A brief explanation of Azure Management Groups and their role in Azure governance.

- **Why Use Management Groups?**: The benefits of using Management Groups for resource organization and policy enforcement.

## Configuration

In this directory, you will find the `main.tf` file, which contains the Terraform configuration for setting up and managing Azure Management Groups. You can customize this configuration to suit your specific Azure environment and requirements.

### Prerequisites

Before you start using the Terraform configuration in this directory, ensure that you have:

- An Azure subscription with the necessary permissions.
- Terraform installed on your local machine.

### Usage

- Review and customize the `main.tf` file to define your Management Group structure.
- Use the Terraform CLI to apply the configuration to your Azure environment.

### Example

```hcl
# Azure Management Groups Configuration

# Provider Configuration
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Define the Azure Management Groups
resource "azurerm_management_group" "example" {
  name        = "YourManagementGroup"
  display_name = "Your Management Group Display Name"
  parent_id   = null

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
    owner       = "Your Name"
  }
}

# Output the Management Group ID
output "management_group_id" {
  value = azurerm_management_group.example.id
}
```

## Getting Started

To begin using the Management Groups configuration in this directory, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the `management-groups` directory.
3. Review the `main.tf` file and customize it as needed.
4. Use the Terraform CLI to apply the configuration.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Getting Started](./GETTING_STARTED.md) guide.

## Best Practices

When working with Azure Management Groups, consider the following best practices:

- **Organization**: Plan and structure your Management Groups hierarchy thoughtfully to align with your Azure governance requirements.

- **Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent and meaningful naming conventions for Management Groups and their display names.

- **Tags**: Use tags effectively to label and categorize Management Groups for better resource management.
