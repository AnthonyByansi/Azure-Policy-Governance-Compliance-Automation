## Introduction

Azure Policies are a powerful tool for enforcing governance and compliance standards in your Azure environment. Custom policies allow you to define and enforce rules that are specific to your organization's requirements. In this directory, we provide examples of custom policies that you can use or customize according to your needs.

## Policy List

### Policy 1: Restrict Unapproved Resource Types

- **Description**: This policy restricts the creation of resources whose types do not match the approved resource types specified in the policy parameter.
- **File**: [policy1.bicep](./policy1.bicep)

### Policy 2: Your Custom Policy Name

- **Description**: Briefly describe the purpose of this policy.
- **File**: [policy2.json](./policy2.json)

### Add More Policies as Needed

You can add more custom policies to this directory by following the naming conventions and file formats used in the existing examples. Ensure that each policy file is properly documented and provides clear information about its purpose and usage.

## Usage

To use these custom policies in your Azure environment, follow these general steps:

1. Review the policy documentation within each policy file to understand its purpose and configuration.

2. Deploy the policy using the Azure Policy service, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Terraform, depending on your preferred method.

3. Customize policy parameters and conditions to align with your specific requirements.

4. Monitor policy compliance and remediate non-compliance as necessary.

For detailed instructions on deploying and managing Azure policies, refer to the official Azure documentation.
