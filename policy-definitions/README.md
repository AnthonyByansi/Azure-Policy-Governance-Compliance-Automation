# Azure Policy Definitions

![Project Logo](link_to_project_logo.png)

This directory contains policy definitions used to enforce governance, compliance, and security standards in your Azure environment. These definitions can be both built-in policies provided by Azure and custom policies tailored to your organization's specific requirements.

## Introduction

Azure Policy is a powerful tool for governing and enforcing compliance standards in your Azure environment. Policy definitions define the rules and conditions that resources in your environment must adhere to. In this directory, we provide examples of both built-in and custom policy definitions to help you manage and secure your Azure resources effectively.

## Policy Types

### Built-in Policies

Azure provides a set of built-in policies that cover common compliance and security requirements. These policies are predefined and can be readily assigned to your Azure resources.

### Custom Policies

Custom policies are policies that you define to enforce specific requirements that are unique to your organization. These policies can be created using various formats, including Bicep, JSON, and ARM templates.

## Policy List

### Built-in Policies

1. **Network Security Group (NSG) Rules**: Enforce network security group rules to restrict incoming traffic.
    - **File**: [networking.json](./built-in-policies/networking.json)

2. **Data Encryption**: Ensure data encryption for Azure storage accounts.
    - **File**: [data-encryption.json](./built-in-policies/data-encryption.json)

### Custom Policies

1. **Policy 1: Custom Policy Name**
    - **Description**: Briefly describe the purpose of this custom policy.
    - **File**: [policy1.bicep](./custom-policies/policy1.bicep)

2. **Policy 2: Your Custom Policy Name**
    - **Description**: Briefly describe the purpose of this custom policy.
    - **File**: [policy2.json](./custom-policies/policy2.json)

### Add More Policies as Needed

You can expand this directory by adding additional policy definitions as required. Be sure to provide clear documentation within each policy file to explain its purpose, conditions, and usage.

## Usage

To use these policy definitions in your Azure environment, follow these general steps:

1. Review the documentation within each policy definition file to understand its purpose and conditions.

2. Assign the policy definition to specific Azure resources or scopes using the Azure Policy service, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Terraform.

3. Monitor policy compliance and remediate non-compliance as necessary.

For detailed instructions on deploying and managing Azure policies, refer to the official Azure documentation.
